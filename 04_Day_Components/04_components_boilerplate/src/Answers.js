// Exercise 1
// Difference Between a Regular Function and an Arrow Function:

/*Regular Function: Regular functions are defined using the function keyword. They have their own this binding and can be used for defining methods, constructors, and regular functions.
Arrow Function: Arrow functions are defined using the => syntax. They do not have their own this binding and inherit the this value from the surrounding lexical context. They are often used for shorter, more concise function expressions. */

// Exercise 2
/* A React component is a reusable building block for creating user interfaces. Components in React can be either class-based or functional. They encapsulate the logic and UI of a part of the application. */

// Exercise 3
/* To create a functional component in React, you define a JavaScript function that returns JSX (UI elements). Functional components are typically used for simple, stateless UI elements. */

// Exercise 4
/* A pure JavaScript function can be used for any purpose in JavaScript and may or may not return a value. A functional component in React is a specific type of function used to define UI elements in a React application. Functional components return JSX and are meant to represent parts of the user interface. */

// Exercise 5
/* A pure JavaScript function can be used for any purpose in JavaScript and may or may not return a value. A functional component in React is a specific type of function used to define UI elements in a React application. Functional components return JSX and are meant to represent parts of the user interface. */

// Exercise 6
/* Yes, you can create reusable button and input field components in React. These components encapsulate the logic and appearance of buttons and input fields, making it easy to reuse them throughout your application. */

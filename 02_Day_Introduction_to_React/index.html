            <h1>What is React</h1>
            <p>
                React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. React uses a declarative programming style, which means that you describe what you want the UI to look like, and React will figure out how to make it happen. This makes it easy to build complex UIs that are responsive and easy to maintain.
